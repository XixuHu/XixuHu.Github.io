Hi! My name is Xixu Hu. I am a third-year PhD student at the School of Data Science, City University of Hong Kong, supervised by Prof. [Qi Wu](http://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/qiwu55.htm) and Prof. [Qingpeng Zhang](http://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/zhang.htm). My research experience mainly lies in domain adaptation, domain generalization, and adversarial robustness. I enjoy both coding and reading mathematical and statistical principles in research papers. Besides that, I'm also hustling to become a solo developer, even though I'm only one percent of the way there. If you would like to get in touch with me for anything fun or to collaborate, please send me an email! I am always eager to learn more and expand my horizons.
