Education
======
* B.S. in Statistics, University of Science and Technology of China, 2016.9-2020.6
* Ph.D in Data Science, City University of Hong Kong, 2020.9-2024.6 (expected)

Work experience
======
* Summer 2019: Research Assistant
  * Department of Mathematics, Arizona State University
  * A Competitive Model for Drug-Resistant Evolution of E. coli cells: 
    - Developed a biological reasonable ODE model to mathematically demonstrate the drug-resistant evolution of E. coli.  
    - Validated our model using real biological experimental data and the numerical simulation fit the data perfectly.
    - Used this model to further inspire new explanation of biological mechanisms about drug- resistant evolution.
  * Mathematical System of Nutrient Allocation Strategy in E. coli cells
    - Built and modified an equation system to depict the dynamic behavior of GFP/OD and greatly fitted the experiments.
    - Used MATLAB to search for the optimized parameters and adjusted parameters in various conditions.
    - Generalized the system into other complicated situations and the proved to be satisfactory and robust.
