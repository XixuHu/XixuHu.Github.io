Hi! My name is Xixu Hu. I am a third-year PhD student at the School of Data Science, City University of Hong Kong. My research experience mainly lies in domain adaptation, domain generalization, and adversarial robustness. I enjoy both coding and reading mathematical and statistical principles in research papers. Besides that, I'm also hustling to become a solo developer, even though I'm only one percent of the way there.
